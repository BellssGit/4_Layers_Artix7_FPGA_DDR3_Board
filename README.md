This board is one part of my CMOS image sensor test station, It features:

1. Artix7 XC7A35T FPGA, 256 pins package
2. 8 bit bus, 4Gbit capacity DDR3 memory, working up to 1066MT/s (Depend on FPGA speed grade)
3. 8 LVDS data lanes + 1 LVDS clock lane (Changeble bank io voltage: 3.3/2.5/1.8), external LVDS termination resistor support 
4. TMDS33 HDMI output
5. 4 GPIOs with bi-directional level shifter for sensor communication
6. 1 CH340 Serial to USB

Made with LCEDA
